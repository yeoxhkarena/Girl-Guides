Anything but not everything you need to know in Girl Guides.
Disclaimer! This is really not EVERYTHING, just based on my own experience 

FAQs about Girl Guides: 
1) Do you need prior achievements or experience in Girl Guides to be able to join? 
2) How many times a week is there CCA? 
3) Does Girl Guides involve a lot of physical work? i.e Are there drills, and if so are they very physically strenuous? 
4) Do you have to memorise all the different types of knots?
